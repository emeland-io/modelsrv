# Model Server

The EmELand model server provides the example mapping of the Emerging Enterprise Landscape as an OpenAPI service. It gives access to the objects of the model. It is implemented as a golang library to allow users to quickly build adapters to their existing IT management solutions.

**Warning: This project is in early alpha and all of the APIs will change!**
